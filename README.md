*Strands PNG Compression*
The goal of this program is to drastically compress simple images, such as game assets, pixel art, and just images with a small amount of unique pixels.

*How to use the program*
Once a release package is available, you will open the program, and type in the directory of the .png file you want to compress, or the strand file you want to decompress.
I am still unsure if this app should be just a commandline app or a visual app like 7zip or winrar.\
